    <p>In the intersection of work and personal life, the work–life balance is the equilibrium between the two. There
      are many aspects of one's personal life that can intersect with work, including family, leisure, and health. A
      work–life balance is bidirectional; for instance, work can interfere with private life, and private life can
      interfere with work. This balance or interface can be adverse in nature or can be beneficial in nature. Recent
      research has shown that the work–life interface has become more boundary-less, especially for technology-enabled
      workers.</p>
