# Final Project Description
## Overview
The goal of the final project is to create your own  responsive website that not only adjusts to the screen size, but also to the user preferences. Your site will support  three distinct views - mobile, tablet, and large screens and react to the user settings of prefers-reduced motion and color scheme. 

The starter  is provided for you as a zip file.  You will need to edit the style.css file to modify the mobile view and add four media queries. You are free to make many personal choices in your submission, but you must fulfill the following requirements:

1. You must replace all of the images from the starter code. Make sure to include alt text.

2. You must replace all of the content in the paragraph tag from the starter code. 

3. Check your code through the w3validator and make necessary changes.

4. Your mobile view must use a mobile-first approach (so no media queries for the mobile view) and

  - a. Use a one column grid with a 10px gap between rows and columns.

5. Your tablet  view must trigger at 772px, not repeat unnecessary rules,  and:

  - a. Use  a  two column grid

  - b. Set the border radius on the figures to create a circular shape

  - c. Set the last figure  to take up both columns

6. Your large screen  view must trigger at 992px, not repeat unnecessary rules,  and:

  - a. Set  every third figure  to take up both columns.

  - b. Remove the border radius from all of the figures.

    - Make sure not to use max-width!!

7. Your prefers-reduced-motion media query must:

  - a. Remove the scroll behavior

8. Assuming that your default color scheme is light, create a media query for dark colors that: 

  - a. Change the background-color of the figures to a dark color.;

  - b. Change the font color of the figures  to a lighter (possibly yellow-ish) color

  - c. Change the border color of the figures  to black.

9. Run your code through the wave validator, particularly to check for color contrast error.  Fix any errors.


Your peer review is a great chance to see the different styling choices that your peers chose and how a little bit of CSS can create a really unique experience.  It will also be a chance to practice changing settings on your computer.   If you need a reminder on how to change your settings you can use these resources:

  - Change your Mac display’s Color Scheme

  - Change colors in Windows

  - Turning on prefers-reduced-motion

## Instructions
1. Review the video that describes the Homework

2. Download the starter code as a zip file from https://intro-webdesign.com/v3/responsive_repo/week4/finalProject.zip

3. Open the code in the editor of your choice and ensure that you can access all of the files

4. Open the index.html file and change the images, making sure to include alternative text.

5. Change the text in the paragraphs.

6. Run the w3 validator.

7. Update the mobile view.

8. Open the browser and check the style.

9. Write your first media query and  add the rules to adjust the style.

10. Check your site on the browser. 

11. Write your second media query and add the rules to adjust the style for the divs.

12. Check your site on the browser. 

13. Write your third  media query and  add the rules to adjust the style.

14. Check your site on the browser. 

15. Write your fourth media query and add the rules to adjust the style for the divs.

16. Check your site on the browser. 

17. Validate your site at https://wave.webaim.org/

18. Host and share your site

19. Peer review sites

## Grading
Your project will be graded by the careful examination of your code by a peer.  Your peers will check that you changed the necessary properties to recreate the two looks.    

- The site returns no errors from the The W3C Markup Validation Service Tool

- The images provided by Colleen have been replaced with new images (with alt text)  

- The text in the paragraphs provided by Colleen have been replaced with new text.  

- The mobile view ( before any media query) uses valid CSS for a single column grid  

- The mobile view ( before any media query) uses valid CSS for a grid gap.  

- The first media query uses min-width and triggers at 772 px.  

- The tablet view uses valid CSS for a two column grid.  

- The tablet view uses valid CSS to set the border radius on the figures to create a circular shape.

- The tablet view uses valid CSS to set the last figure  to take up both columns  

- The second media query (for the large-screen view)  uses min-width and triggers at 992 px.

- The tablet view uses valid CSS to remove the border radius from all of the figures.

- When the user has set their preference to reduce motion/animation the scroll from clicking the return to Top button is disabled.  

- When the user has set their preference to use a dark color scheme the figures have a dark background color, a light font color, and a black border.  

- The site returns no errors from the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.
